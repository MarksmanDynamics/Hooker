# Hooker
A simple and easy to use tool developed for sending messages through discord webhook bots.
You don't need discord installed to use this tool, the messages will still go through.

## Installation (Windows)

* Download the files
* Create discord webhook
 - Go to your server settings/Integrations/Webhooks/Create webook/Copy webhook URL
  - More in-depth explanation [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/discord_notifications.html)
* Paste the webhook url from discord into Hooker
* Done! You can now send messages to the webhook

  (To clear the message history go to hooker/appbag/ edit conversation.bat, delete everything inside and save it.)

### Disclaimers

This code will not recognize if your webhook is invalid, so make sure you double check if you encounter any issues.

Slight visual artifacts may appear, altering the UI. These usually should not interact with the code at all,
so if you see something off you should be able to continue using Hooker just fine.
In the case that the artifacts are really bad/annoying, you can simply restart the window and it should fix them.

This code is fully programmed in batch and it is made to be handled with Windows.
Other OS' might require extra steps to run the code.
